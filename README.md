# Docker and python-fastapi demo
Made for private challenge to make me learn how docker works.<br>
Script works fine on Windows and Ubuntu and sitting on port 8000, waits for any request (localhost:8000/hello) then returns the content of the web-page that was first search result on duckduckgo.
<br><br>Thanks to Saidose for explaining and helping with Docker.
